# Extinguished Spark
A program designed to get around Sparx Mathsâ„¢ bookwork checks by taking a screenshot every time you press enter (thus taking a picture of your answer)
I wanted to make it automatic but tesseract isn't detecting the bookwork codes so I'd need to right something in JS (sigh) to do that
